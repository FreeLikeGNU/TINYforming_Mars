*TINYforming Mars is a 1-2 player game set in the distant future; where mankind has mastered the technologies needed tot turn our lifeless neighbor, Mars, into a thriving destination for humanity.*

**Components:**
1. Project Cards x7
2. Map Cards x2
3. Credits x10
4. Player Cubes: White x3, Black x3
5. Parameter Cubes: Heat (Red) x11, Greenery (Green) x7, Water (Blue) x4
6. Resource Tokens: Nature x2, Production x1, Science x1

**Objective:** Each player is attempting to terraform Mars by completing projects that fulfill one or more Mars` parameters for sustaining life, those being: Heat, Oxygen (provided by Greenery), and Water. The player that is able to complete more projects towards this goal, while building cities on prime Martian real estate, will be the winner.

**Game Flow:** The game takes place over several rounds, known as Generations, in which players will alternate taking turns. First the players will draft Project Cards which describe Projects that they have access to. Then, on a player`s turn, he can complete one of his own Projects, one of the Standard Projects, or pass. When both players collect income to begin the next Generation.

**End Game:** The three parameters: Heat, Greenery? and Water are represented by Red, Green, and Blue Cubes, respectively. The players will acquire or place these Cubes by completing Projects and Standard Projects. When the supply of at least 2 of the 3 types have been exhausted or these are no vacant hexes on the map, that Generation will be the final Generation of the game. Once that Generation is over, the players will count their scores. Highest score wins.

## SETUP
1. Players will decide if they want to play the Tharsis Map or the Elysium Map and set it up in the center of the table.
2. Players will randomly determine who will be the White player and who will be the Black player. The White player starts the game and will be first in the odd Generations (rounds 1,3,5...) and the Black player will be first in the even Generations (rounds 2,4,6...). Each player takes the 3 Cubes that match the color they are playing.
3. Each player takes 5 Credit Cubes (Yellow).
4. The 3 types of Parameter Cubes (Red, Green, and Blue) are placed off to the side of Map to create a supply.
5. The 4 Resource Tokens (Nature, Production, and Science) are placed off to the side of Map to create a supply. ![image of resource tokens]()
6. Take the 7 Project cards and shuffle them. Once shuffled, place them at the side of the board to create Draw Desk.
7. The White player draws and flips over the first Project card and determines which side will face him and which side will face the Black player. The Black player draws and flips over the second Project card and determines which side will face him and which side will face the White player. Finally, the White player draws and flips over the third Project card and determines which side will face him and which side will face the Black player.
8. The Black player places one of his Black Cubes in any hex not reserved for water. This is the starting location of his first city. The White player then places one of his White Cubes in any hex not reserved for water *and not adjacent to the hex occupied by the Black player's city*. This is starting location of his first city.

## PARAMETERS
The three Parameters, Heat, Greenery, and Water are how you terraform Mars. They are represented by Red, Gree, and Blue Cubes, respectively. They are acquired by activating Card Projects and Standard Projects. When at least 2 out of the 3 parameter Cube types have been exhausted from the supply, the end of game has been triggered and that will be the final Generation.

![image heat parameter]() **Heat:** When a player gains a Heat Cube, he takes a Red Cube from the supply and adds it to his own personal supply. Each Heat Cube in player's personal supply is worth 1 victory point at the end of the game. A Heat Cube on the map is worth -1 point to any city adjacent to that Heat Cube.

![image greenery parameter]() **Greenery:** When placing a Greenery Cube, take a Green Cube from the supply and add ot to a vacant hex on the map that is *not* reserved for water. Each Greenery Cube that is adjacent to a city scores that city's owner 1 victory point - plus 1 *additional* VP os it is adjacent to only that player's city and not his opponent's city during end game scoring.

![image water parameter]() **Water:** When placing a Water Cube, take a Blue Cube from supply and add is to a vacant hex on the map reserved for water. A hex that is reserved for water has a light blue background. When placing a Water Cube, if the hex has a Tag, gain a matching Resource Token from the supply if there are any available. In addition, if the Water Cube is placed adjacent to any other Water Cubes, the placing player gains 1 Credit for each adjacent Water Cube. During the Income Phase of a Generation, a Water Cube adds 1 to the income of each adjacent city. Each Water Cube that is adjacent to only one of the two players is worth 1 victory point to that player at the end of the game.

## MAP
Each map of Mars is made up of 19 hexes. There are 14 hexes that can have Greenery Cubes or City Cubes and 5 blue-tinted hexes that are reserved for Water Cubes. ![image mars map example]()

![image bonus hex]() **Bonus Hex:** A Bonus Hex has a Tag in the center and a thick border matching the color of the Tag. If a player has a city in a Bonus Hex, it counts as having one of that Tag for as long as his city is there. There are 5 Bonus Hexes.

![image empty hex]() **Empty Hex:** There are 9 Empty Hexes that offers no additional benefit.

![image water hex]() **Water Hex:** A Water Hex has a light blue background. If a player places a Parameter Cube in a Water Hex containing a Resource Token icon, he immediately gains that token to his supply.


On a player's turn, if he meets all the requirements of one of his Project cards (the sides facing him), he can activate that Project in order to perform that card's ability. These abilities usually allow the player to gain a Heat Cube or place a Greenery or Water Cube on the Map. The effective use of Project cards will help win the game. A player can only activate each of his Project cards once per Generation.

![image project card]() 
1. **Project Name**
2. **Cost in Credits.** If the Cost has an **\*** after the number, the cost can be reduced by an effect of the Project. When paying for a Project, the player must place 1 Credit Cube on the Project card to show he has used that Project this Generation. Additional Credits used to pay the cost are returned to the supply.
If a player gains Credits during an Action Phase, he is not allowed to take any Credits that have been placed on Project cards.
3. **Requirements:** Each Project requires that you have access to certain number and type of Tags. The Tags can come from any combination of your Project Cards (see #6), your cities on bonus hexes, and from spending (discarding) Resource Tokens.
In Addition to the Tags, some Projects also require that a certain number of Parameter Cubes. The Heat requirement refers to the combined amount of both players' personal supplies of Heat Cubes *plus* any Head Cubes on the map. The Greenery or Water Cube requirement, refers to green/blue Cubes on the Map.
4. **Effect icons:** The ability of the project is depicted here for quick reference. Also, The background color of the card indicates witch of the three parameters the project will help complete. Red/Heat, Green/Greenery, and Blue/Water. There is also Grey; this type will not complete parameters, but will offer some other ability.
5. **Effect:** The ability of Project card is described in words to correspond with the Effect icons. If there are no available Parameter Cubes that match the corresponding Project, that Project cannot be activated.
**IMPORTANT:** The text of a Project card supersedes this rulebook.
6. **Tags:** Each Project card immediately offers 2 Tags on the side facing you that can be used to meet the requirements of your ither Project cards or of a Standard Project. You do not have to complete the Project to gain the Tags the Project providers, this is automatic and you have them as soon as the cards are chosen at the beginning of each Generation. The 5 Tag types are:
Energy ![image tag energy](), Production ![image tag production](), Nature ![image tag nature](), Science ![image tag science](), Space ![image tag space]()

## STANDARD PROJECTS
Once per Generation a player can complete one of the five Standard Projects if he meets all requirements of the chosen one. When a player activates his Standard Project, he places one of his Player Cubes on the Standard Project spot to show that he cannot activate another Standard Project this Generation. Most of the Standard Projects have a cost and Tag requirement similar to Project cards.

1. **Sell Patent:** Gains 1 Credit. There are no requirements or cost for this. If there are no Credits in the supply, a player cannot take this Standard Project.
2. **Build City:** Place or relocate one Player Cube on the map as city, observing the following rules: **a)** A player is limited to 2 cities. **b)** A city must be plaiced in vacant hex on the map. **c)** A player cannot place a city in hex reserved for water (light blue background). **d)** A player cannot place a city adjacent to any other city.
If player has already placed his cities, he may take this Standard Project to relocate one of his cities ti a new hex, observing all the same placement rules.
3. **Import Water:** Place an available Water Cube from the supply onto a vacant hex reserved for water.
4. **Greenhouses:** Place an available Greenery Cube from the supply onto a vacant hex not reserved for water.
5. **Energy Farm:** The player gains an available Heat Cube from the supply.

## RESOURCE TOKENS
When a Parameter Cube is placed in a space reserved for a Water Cube that has a Tag icon, the placing player gains a Resource Token matching that icon from the supply, If there are no matching Resource Tokens available, the player gains nothing. A Resource Token can be spent by returning it to the supply when a player needs that matching Tag for a Project ot Standard Project. Some Projects offer the activating player their choice of an available Resource Token.
